The Office of Policy and Management (OPM) noted in its [Legal Issues in Interagency Data Sharing Report](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/CT-Data/PA-19153-Legal-Issues-in-Interagency-Data-Sharing-Report-11520.pdf) that leveraging data from multiple state agencies can improve program administration, policy analysis, research, and performance management. Connecticut state agencies, however, may not be harnessing the full potential of multi-agency data due to challenges in data sharing.

In this playbook, we lay out strategies that will help Connecticut state agencies overcome the obstacles to sharing data. The strategies are based on best practices from other states, specific examples and methods from Connecticut state agencies, and the recommendations found in OPM’s report. 

## How to use this playbook

We recommend that agencies that host data read the following sections in order to build a data sharing framework that respects the laws and regulations that apply to their data:

 * [Enabling Data Sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qo8inrsVmyThe3vz7_eoNk0IlgFOJ9Ig3IOrOz5PocM/edit?ts=5e4c6a36#heading=h.vnne50dskbx2)
 * [Safeguarding Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qo8inrsVmyThe3vz7_eoNk0IlgFOJ9Ig3IOrOz5PocM/edit?ts=5e4c6a36#heading=h.1t3h5sf)
 * [Responding to Data Requests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qo8inrsVmyThe3vz7_eoNk0IlgFOJ9Ig3IOrOz5PocM/edit?ts=5e4c6a36#heading=h.6jpzae4qt2pi)

Agencies that seek to request data will benefit from the following sections to initiate strong data sharing partnerships:

 * [Tips for Preparing a Successful Data Request](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qo8inrsVmyThe3vz7_eoNk0IlgFOJ9Ig3IOrOz5PocM/edit?ts=5e4c6a36#heading=h.ppu5gehm2n4s)
 * [Identify the type of legal data sharing agreement you’ll need](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qo8inrsVmyThe3vz7_eoNk0IlgFOJ9Ig3IOrOz5PocM/edit?ts=5e4c6a36#heading=h.p42wbxson83w)

Finally, we recommend that both parties read the guidance on [appropriate channels for data transfer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qo8inrsVmyThe3vz7_eoNk0IlgFOJ9Ig3IOrOz5PocM/edit?ts=5e4c6a36#heading=h.19c6y18) before transferring data to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of the data being shared. 

## Methodology

The guidance in this playbook is the culmination of a 4-month research initiative conducted by OPM, OEC, and Skylight Digital, a digital consultancy for government. 

Our research involved:

 * 13 user interviews with data sharing practitioners across Connecticut state agencies
 * Research into best practices from data sharing experts
 * Research into case studies from other states
 * A detailed technology tool review to document the secure channels for data transfer available to Connecticut state agencies
 * Findings from OPM’s [Legal Issues in Interagency Data Sharing Report](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/CT-Data/PA-19153-Legal-Issues-in-Interagency-Data-Sharing-Report-11520.pdf)

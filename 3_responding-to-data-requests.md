Having an established protocol for responding to a request for data will save you time and effort (see [Develop a data request process](/data-sharing-playbook/enabling-data-sharing/#develop-a-data-request-process)). The following suggestions will help you respond smoothly to different types of requests.

## Ask key questions up front.

Establish a process for how key questions are asked, answered, and documented. We’ve included a detailed list of questions to ask in the section on [developing a request process](/data-sharing-playbook/enabling-data-sharing/#develop-a-data-request-process), including:

 * What is the purpose of the request?
 * How does the requester plan to use the data?
 * Who will have access to the data?
 * What is the specific data they are requesting and what are the specific parameters?

If the requester is planning to combine data with another dataset, this will require careful review and consideration from both teams. This could be a complex process, and we’ve included some discussion of data linking in the [Linking Datasets](/data-sharing-playbook/linking-datasets) section.

## Identify the type of legal data sharing agreement you will need.

Legal counsel should advise you on the specific type of legal agreement needed to share data. However, the information below can help frame productive conversations with your data-sharing partners.

The type of agreement you will need depends on factors like:

 * Whether the data contains personally identifiable information (PII)
 * The sensitivity of the data requested
 * The type of organization requesting the data
 * How the data will be used
 * The scope and duration of the request
 
There are multiple types of data sharing mechanisms available to state agencies. Each of them is governed by unique requirements and legal considerations.

### But first: Do you even need an agreement?

Sharing data that is open to the public does not require an agreement. If the requesting party doesn’t need to identify specific individuals, it may be preferable to release the data to the public by publishing it on the Connecticut Open Data Portal (data.ct.gov). To publish data on the open data portal, refer to the [publication guidelines](https://portal.ct.gov/CTData/Content/Agency-Guidance) developed by OPM. 

## Common types of agreements

The following section provides a brief description of these common types of agreement and when to use them:

 * Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
 * Data Use Agreement (DUA)
 * Enterprise Memorandum of Understanding (E-MOU)
 * Data Sharing Agreement (DSA)
 * Business Associate Agreement (BAA)
 * Statement of Work (SOW)
 * Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)

While each of these agreements has a specific function (and a context in which it is appropriate to use), it is not necessarily the case that an agency looking to share data can solely choose any one of these agreements and move forward. These agreements often work together to provide the full details of the nature of a data sharing agreement (for example, the E-MOU, DSA, and DUA tend to work together rather than operating alone).

### Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

MOUs are best suited for ongoing data transfers that have consistent and formalized parameters. An MOU:

 * Identifies the roles and responsibilities of the involved groups
 * Describes why an agreement is required
 * Specifies the terms and conditions for the partnership

MOUs are especially important when the basis for a data sharing relationship is grant funding or a service contract. The process of establishing an “MOU enables potential partners to identify similarities and differences in their priorities and goals, available resources (time, money, and expertise), project timelines, and expected outcomes prior to collaboration.”1

### Data Use Agreement (DUA) or Data Use Licenses (DUL)

Data Use Agreements (DUAs) or Data Use Licenses (DULs) are best suited for individual data sharing transactions. DUAs precisely specify the parameters for the data transfer, who will have access to the data, the intended use of the data, and how the requester should destroy data.

They may also “include specific time parameters for data use or provide special provisions for data disclosure or requirements for the data holding agency to review resulting research before its publication.”2

### Enterprise Memorandum of Understanding (E-MOU)

An E-MOU is a long-term agreement signed by multiple parties in order to facilitate multiple and diverse data sharing requests. E-MOUs usually:

 * Describe involved parties
 * Set up governance boards
 * Define codified request procedures
 * Highlight the rights and responsibilities of data stewards and requesters

E-MOUs are mostly used to facilitate government agency to government agency data sharing and have been implemented in multiple states.3

### Data Sharing Agreement (DSA)

Data Sharing Agreements are best suited for establishing long-term data sharing relationships that involve multiple transfers with different parameters. Data Sharing Agreements identify the involved parties and the terms and conditions for the partnership. They can stand independently or be an addendum to an MOU or E-MOU.

Since it defines an ongoing relationship for multiple transfers, a DSA may also define a process for authorizing data requests along with requirements for storing, protecting, and disposing of shared data.

### Business Associate Agreement (BAA)

A Business Associate Agreement is a written arrangement that specifies each party’s responsibilities when it comes to PHI (personal health information). HIPAA requires covered entities to only work with business associates who assure complete protection of PHI.

### Statement of Work

The statement of work is a detailed overview of the project in all its dimensions. It’s also a way to share what the project entails with those who are working on the project, whether they are collaborating or contracted to work on the project. This includes vendors and contractors who are bidding to work on the project.

### Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)

A non-disclosure agreement is a binding contract between two or more parties that prevents sensitive information from being shared with any others.

## P20 WIN data sharing agreements 

The P20 WIN [Enterprise Memorandum of Understanding](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/OPM/P20Win/NEW-Governance-Agreements/P20WIN-EMOU-SignedParticipatingAgencies-09092021.pdf) (Enterprise MOU) outlines the guidelines for data sharing, governance structure, and confidentiality and security requirements for P20 WIN. The Enterprise MOU is signed by all agencies participating in P20 WIN. 

[Data Sharing Agreements](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/OPM/P20Win/NEW-Governance-Agreements/P20-WIN-DSA-template.pdf) are signed by Participating Agencies, the Data Integration Hub, and Data Recipients for specific data requests. This agreement outlines the responsibilities of all parties, data users, cell suppression policies, fees, and Exhibits. Exhibits include:

 * Exhibit A - Data Sharing Request Form and requested variables;
 * Exhibit B - User Acknowledgement Form;
 * Exhibit C - Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement;
 * Exhibit D - IRB approval, if needed and appropriate;
 * Exhibit F - Data Destruction Certificate; and the
 * Enterprise MOU

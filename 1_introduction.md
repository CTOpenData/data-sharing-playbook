The Office of Policy and Management (OPM) noted in its [Legal Issues in Interagency Data Sharing Report](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/CT-Data/PA-19153-Legal-Issues-in-Interagency-Data-Sharing-Report-11520.pdf) that leveraging data from multiple state agencies can improve program administration, policy analysis, research, and performance management. Connecticut state agencies, however, may not be harnessing the full potential of multi-agency data due to challenges in data sharing.

This is a test

## How to use this playbook

We recommend that agencies that host data read the following sections in order to build a data sharing framework that respects the laws and regulations that apply to their data:

 * [Enabling Data Sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qo8inrsVmyThe3vz7_eoNk0IlgFOJ9Ig3IOrOz5PocM/edit?ts=5e4c6a36#heading=h.vnne50dskbx2)
 * [Safeguarding Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qo8inrsVmyThe3vz7_eoNk0IlgFOJ9Ig3IOrOz5PocM/edit?ts=5e4c6a36#heading=h.1t3h5sf)
 * [Responding to Data Requests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qo8inrsVmyThe3vz7_eoNk0IlgFOJ9Ig3IOrOz5PocM/edit?ts=5e4c6a36#heading=h.6jpzae4qt2pi)

Agencies that seek to request data will benefit from the following sections to initiate strong data sharing partnerships:

 * [Tips for Preparing a Successful Data Request](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qo8inrsVmyThe3vz7_eoNk0IlgFOJ9Ig3IOrOz5PocM/edit?ts=5e4c6a36#heading=h.ppu5gehm2n4s)
 * [Identify the type of legal data sharing agreement you’ll need](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qo8inrsVmyThe3vz7_eoNk0IlgFOJ9Ig3IOrOz5PocM/edit?ts=5e4c6a36#heading=h.p42wbxson83w)

Finally, we recommend that both parties read the guidance on [appropriate channels for data transfer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qo8inrsVmyThe3vz7_eoNk0IlgFOJ9Ig3IOrOz5PocM/edit?ts=5e4c6a36#heading=h.19c6y18) before transferring data to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of the data being shared. 

## Methodology

The guidance in this playbook is the culmination of a 4-month research initiative conducted by OPM, OEC, and Skylight Digital, a digital consultancy for government. 

Our research involved:

 * 13 user interviews with data sharing practitioners across Connecticut state agencies
 * Research into best practices from data sharing experts
 * Research into case studies from other states
 * A detailed technology tool review to document the secure channels for data transfer available to Connecticut state agencies
 * Findings from OPM’s [Legal Issues in Interagency Data Sharing Report](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/CT-Data/PA-19153-Legal-Issues-in-Interagency-Data-Sharing-Report-11520.pdf)
